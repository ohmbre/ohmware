# Î©hmwares
firmware, kernel and operating system for ohmbre eurorack synth hardware

### Building

```
git checkout https://github.com/ohmbre/ohmware.git
source ohmware/setupenv
```
make sure you've attached a 4GB+ microSD card and that it's not mounted already
```
sdformat /dev/<SD writing device name>
ohmsweetohm
```

Congrats if that last command took less than two hours.  Now that you've built your own
operating system, insert the card into the ohmbre and it should boot up to a bash shell. If you'd like some synthesizer with your computer, head on over [this way](https://github.com/ohmbre/ohmstudio) and build the rest.

If you forgot to build a dope eurorack synthesizer module to run all of this, you better [get started](https://github.com/ohmbre/ohmbre) here. It's open hardware, cheap, and even DIY-able.
